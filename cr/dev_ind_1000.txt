8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth .	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon . never knew i could love a digital camera so much .	1
with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .	1
i own this phone for about 6 months now , i have used the following features : bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook , transfer files ( movies , songs ) , i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes .	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .	1
i got it working fast enough .	1
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad	1
although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big .	1
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! . it is indeed worth nothing .	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .	1
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .	1
don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space .	0
t610 supports only midi files .	0
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .	0
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .	0
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .	0
another plus in my book , no file limits ! .	1
the dvd player does not work properly .	0
the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad .	1
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .	0
the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change .	0
i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed .	0
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .	0
it 's oval and . . . nice .	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .	1
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^	1
the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard .	1
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .	0
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .	1
my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above .	0
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .	1
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .	0
very annoying .	0
after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window .	0
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .	0
putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .	1
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records .	1
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .	0
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .	0
its nice look is also a plus .	1
i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .	0
i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail .	0
what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes ! .	1
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .	0
for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well .	1
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .	0
great camera .	1
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .	0
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .	0
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .	1
and we still love it ! .	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .	0
speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable ! .	1
for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .	1
now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems .	1
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .	0
my only significant complaint is sound quality .	0
"they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "" handle "" and ship a cd ? . -- and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails ."	0
the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated .	0
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .	1
i liked this one enough to buy another .	1
all the buttons & necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .	1
there was neither picture nor sound .	0
- included creative software is pretty poor .	0
it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .	1
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ) .	1
"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use ."	1
when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing . . . it 's tiny ! .	1
i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality .	1
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .	1
there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .	1
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck	0
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .	0
the image quality is excellent .	1
there are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be text ed to you at no cost .	1
battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times . . . the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .	1
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .	0
the bass treble the sound detail is aw some .	1
compatibility with other devices is excellent too ; . i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with *anyone 's* mixed mode ) .	1
it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .	1
its stable , so a curious toddler can 't easily tip it over .	1
the storage capacity is great .	1
i have the black one and adore it .	1
"not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 "" chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping"	0
the volume .	0
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .	1
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .	0
you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .	1
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .	0
one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem .	1
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .	1
its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market .	1
the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus .	1
if you think you are saving $40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a makita .	0
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .	1
it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .	1
new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration .	1
it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .	1
i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone .	0
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .	1
i 'm really happy with this purchase .	1
now i know why - they are pieces of junk .	0
it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere .	1
"on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside ."	0
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .	1
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .	1
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .	1
the more i work with it , the more i love it ! .	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .	0
also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up .	0
the look & feel : i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance .	1
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .	1
"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . """	0
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .	0
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc . , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .	1
on my main computer the software did not work right .	0
well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more .	1
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .	1
the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .	0
2 ) scroll button / switch	0
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .	0
when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money .	1
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .	1
the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving .	1
battery life is ok .	1
the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! .	1
you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .	1
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .	1
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player .	0
the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .	1
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .	1
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it .	1
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .	0
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .	1
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .	1
it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight .	1
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .	0
so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http : //www . suavest . com/forum6 . html	1
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .	0
i am impressed with this camera inside and out .	1
"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical ."	1
. lens cap is a really annoying	0
memory/storage - seemingly boundless .	1
i highly recommend this ! .	1
overall , i am very pleased with it .	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .	0
at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! .	1
really easy to use .	1
this is a must have product for all new moms ! .	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .	1
the door would not close .	0
do n 't buy this player .	0
i would put the hitachi up with the best ! .	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .	0
2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .	1
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .	1
you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .	1
i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time ! .	0
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .	0
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .	0
the size of the camera is perfect .	1
i forgot , the case does n 't fit .	0
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .	0
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .	1
so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? . size[+2]	1
i upgraded from a very small 3 . 2 max camera to this camera with great results .	1
this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .	1
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .	1
installation was as near automatic as can be .	1
at 128 the songs sound very good .	1
finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier .	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .	1
"unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition ."	1
but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes .	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .	1
outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at&t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .	1
but the major problem i had was with the software .	0
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .	1
the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .	0
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .	1
on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative .	0
even with the waterproof housing it is small .	1
by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .	1
it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .	1
my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag .	0
1- small .	1
hate to wait between shots	1
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .	1
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds .	1
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .	0
my first impression was positive .	1
i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue .	1
but for what i do use it is perfect .	1
some adjustments in the settings could help make it better .	0
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )	0
3 . bags are easy to change .	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! .	1
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .	1
one complaint . . . the screen is too easily scratched ! .	0
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .	1
"if you have an older version of "" internet security "" installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install ."	0
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .	1
it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .	0
2 ) phone is awfully slow .	0
the camera res ponce is very quick .	1
it is hot enough to be annoying .	0
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .	0
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .	1
the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad .	0
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .	0
the battery is removable .	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player .	1
"we tried the "" finding memo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason ."	0
definitely a great camera .	1
it films 10 second video , for crying out loud .	1
first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software .	1
the touch pad is over-sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive .	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .	1
it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography .	1
the manual is excellent .	1
the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 . 11b speeds and not 802 . 11g .	0
then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely .	0
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .	1
feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player ; . equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore .	1
the storage capacity is great for me --	1
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; .	1
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .	1
the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it .	1
i do give create to creative for their attractive design .	1
) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .	1
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .	0
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .	1
to set up the box , wap , and ether nest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins .	1
this model appears to be especially good .	1
when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental .	1
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .	1
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .	1
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .	0
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .	1
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .	1
even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! .	1
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera .	1
the phone is very light weight .	1
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )	1
"the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . ."	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .	0
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .	1
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .	0
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .	1
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .	1
t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .	1
yes , the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem .	1
it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .	1
nokia does not disappoint in this model .	1
you need the software to actually transfer files	0
to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem .	0
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .	1
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .	1
although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better .	0
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .	1
one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .	0
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .	0
"there 's even an equalizer ( under "" settings "" ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , "" deep "" , and electronic ."	1
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; . it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names ; . you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc . ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .	0
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .	0
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .	0
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .	1
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .	1
everything i wanted ! . the apple ipod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason .	1
weak points : - touch pad : design could be better - volume control : controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick .	0
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .	1
the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .	0
i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well .	1
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .	0
"at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well ."	0
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .	1
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! .	1
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .	1
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .	1
t-mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate .	0
this is the best phone i have seen .	1
the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .	1
takes excellent photos .	1
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .	1
very simple and painless .	1
even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys .	1
i also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .	1
"4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "" other than phone "" functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done ."	0
3660 had similar features , but that is big in size .	1
it looks great - and is loaded with features .	1
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .	0
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .	0
1 . your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism .	0
no in box accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope . . . moveable parts -- this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; . with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; . note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium .	0
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual .	1
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .	1
it is n 't big and offensive , though you would n 't know it by looking at the pics it takes .	1
i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .	1
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .	1
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .	1
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .	0
with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive .	1
but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100 .	1
i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions .	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .	1
after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine .	1
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! .	0
the panorama modes are wonderful .	1
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .	1
the in ital setup of the router was simple .	1
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod's dirty secret . com .	1
as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains .	1
i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result . . . junk software .	0
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller .	1
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .	0
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .	1
i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .	1
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .	1
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr / cadre / dvd / dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the giff , progressive scan feature .	1
in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .	1
another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging[-2]	0
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .	1
about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .	0
i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $300 systematic because he saw what this router can do .	1
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .	0
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .	0
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .	1
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual .	1
great quality picture and features .	1
i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .	1
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .	0
opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .	0
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! .	0
i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up .	0
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .	1
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .	0
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .	0
i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! .	1
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .	0
we 've never experienced odor from the pail .	1
in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece .	0
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .	0
frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used .	1
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .	1
i 've had nothing but good luck with t-mobile .	1
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .	1
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .	1
i also love that you can flip the device with one hand . . .	1
fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .	1
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .	1
"i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the "" mixed mode "" feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router ."	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .	0
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .	1
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .	0
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	1
"difficult navigation - i wo n 't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate ."	0
the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple .	0
i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it .	1
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .	1
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .	0
after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out .	0
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! .	0
my son tried it and he too couldn 't change the speed without an assist .	0
1 . the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find ! .	1
door broke after a month .	0
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all	1
we are overall pleased with product .	1
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc .	1
it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ? .	0
my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic .	1
the service from t-mobile is very good too .	1
the diaper champ is the best ! .	1
this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .	0
i love this camera .	1
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .	0
this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .	1
the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit .	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .	0
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; . this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .	0
nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price	1
5- excelent software package .	1
all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .	1
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .	1
i 'd say that this camera is perfect .	1
the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! . ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e . g . covers of songs ) , etc .	1
this phone is a winner . . .	1
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .	1
i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut .	1
i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router .	0
the moveable lcd screen is great .	1
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .	1
there is no odor and it is very easy to use .	1
and it holds so much music and audio files .	1
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; . it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 . 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! .	1
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .	1
even the instruction booklet is out of order .	0
the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10% or so .	0
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .	1
a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering .	1
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .	1
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .	1
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .	1
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .	1
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .	1
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself .	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc . , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .	1
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast .	0
it definitely keeps the smell out .	1
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .	1
i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )	1
it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow .	1
ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone i have owned .	1
it also holds a lot more diapers .	1
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .	1
1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players .	1
i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone .	0
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking	0
even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .	1
hard drive screws up occasionally	0
the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot .	1
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .	1
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .	1
mediasource did not recognize my tags ! .	0
it doesn 't bog down under load .	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .	1
have had problems since the first day	0
) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors . .	1
however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .	0
you 'll love it ! .	1
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .	1
the diaper champ is the best we found ! .	1
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .	1
"update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it ! ."	1
all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional .	0
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .	1
if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .	0
the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full .	0
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .	0
- solid , high-quality construction	1
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .	1
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .	1
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .	0
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident .	0
the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .	1
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .	1
i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better .	0
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .	1
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .	1
utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list .	1
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .	1
the included memory card is too small .	0
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 .	1
1 . pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .	0
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .	1
the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks .	0
the interface works great .	1
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .	0
im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .	0
i didnt have any installation problems ; . and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate .	1
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .	1
the height adjustment works well- not perfect .	1
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .	1
its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it .	1
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet .	1
it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .	1
also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you .	1
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc .	1
sound : this is where i love zen the most .	1
this thing is trash .	0
i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus ! .	1
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38 ; . phone lying by your pillow side .	1
i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .	0
fact is , it could n 't be easier to use .	1
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .	0
the battery life on this phone is surreal .	1
remember , this phone uses an operating system - symbian . . . and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k colors .	1
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; . the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .	1
great colors , pictures and white balance .	1
3 ) 4x zoom is nice	1
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .	1
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc . ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .	0
but , for the money it is a good machine .	1
i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this .	1
most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery .	1
now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full .	0
it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges .	1
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .	0
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .	1
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .	1
"the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted ."	1
honestly , i love this player .	1
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .	1
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider .	1
as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on .	0
what i like the most : - small and solid feel .	1
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .	1
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	0
after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon . com and see for yourself ) .	0
another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers .	1
other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either .	1
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .	1
8 battery life is excellent .	1
i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time .	0
the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom .	1
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .	1
the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly .	1
"sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 . 0 "" adjust levels "" function . . . not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though ."	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! .	1
it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ? .	1
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .	1
i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .	1
"warning ! . the windows "" remove program "" feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program ."	0
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .	1
and the battery life is bad ! .	0
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire .	0
and it is very easy to clean .	1
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion .	1
it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! . ) .	1
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .	1
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .	1
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .	1
after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ) .	0
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite .	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day .	0
the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have .	0
"i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs . the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a "" customer priority id number . """	0
other plusses : changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .	1
if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time . .	0
the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .	1
it plays everything , even vcd 's .	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .	0
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .	1
it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera .	1
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! . ! . ! . ! . i love this phone ! . ! . ! .	1
the quick sync is n 't any good because it either needs to be configured properly or just is n 't very useful .	0
my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long .	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s .	1
having usb 2 . 0 makes for very fast transfers .	1
a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it .	1
i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .	1
it 's a very intuitive program .	1
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .	1
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .	0
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . .	1
i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $$$ , it was definitely worth it .	1
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you .	1
some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .	1
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .	1
price ! .	1
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .	1
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive .	0
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? .	0
plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great .	1
i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions .	0
"putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything ( unless the hold feature is improved : it asks if you want to "" unholy "" for every button up press ) second , i 'm worried about the durability of the player ."	0
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so .	1
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .	0
however , this product performed well below my expectation .	0
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .	1
2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots .	0
lastly , the price is fantastic :	1
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas .	0
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .	0
this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .	0
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .	1
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) . . .	0
being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills .	1
"second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer ."	1
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .	1
i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker .	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .	1
we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $6 . 00 for a year of bags- can 't beat that ! . ! .	1
"working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! . ! ."	1
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .	1
i find it pretty easy to use . . . and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) . . .	1
but it ; . you won 't regret it .	1
great design -- very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( virtual ones are the only competition ) ; . and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus .	1
all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time .	1
if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth .	0
also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs .	0
since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .	1
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .	0
nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .	1
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .	1
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) .	0
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .	1
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .	1
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .	1
i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements .	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .	1
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .	0
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .	0
i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud .	0
i love this camera ! .	1
the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved .	0
i think it 's great .	1
the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use .	0
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .	1
the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .	0
the screen is quite big ( between all hand phone ) , but the just about 65000 color .	1
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .	1
like other reviewers , installation was hell .	0
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .	1
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .	0
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago .	1
the good : small size ; . durable-seeming metal case ; . easy to use ; . visually distinctive ; . good picture quality ; . fast usb connection ; . mostly intuitive operation ; . really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas .	1
however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off .	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .	0
shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking .	0
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .	1
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .	1
pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room .	1
comments : overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market .	1
and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .	1
sharper pictures .	1
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations .	0
it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in 'shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very well in general .	0
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .	1
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .	1
this is a quality product , not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china .	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .	1
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .	0
i was looking for something that wasn 't too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail .	1
go for the champ .	1
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .	1
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .	0
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .	1
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .	1
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .	1
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .	0
it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality .	1
the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use .	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .	1
no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .	0
you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3-player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! . ! . ) and also you can carry it in your pocket : ) .	1
my experience with installation was quite good .	1
the powershot g3 is a great camera .	1
this product is by far the best broadband router on the market , i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers , worked great for about a year .	1
"this is a nice feature ( i . e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem ."	1
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .	1
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! .	1
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .	1
again , this is a design flaw in the headphone ! .	0
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .	1
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .	1
i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money .	1
i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine .	1
only con i can think of is no camera . . . .	0
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .	1
the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application .	0
unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs .	0
apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini .	0
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .	1
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .	1
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .	1
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy .	1
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits .	1
when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better	1
i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice .	1
can 't get easier than that ! .	0
value : comparing data storage with price .	1
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .	1
my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites .	0
still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises .	0
no need for deodorizers .	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .	1
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .	1
the vibration is not top .	0
it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket .	1
"it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song "" piece of cr -- ! . "" , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to ."	0
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .	1
they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact .	1
the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .	0
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v .	1
i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it .	1
the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered .	0
my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature .	0
yes , i recommend it over the competition .	1
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift .	0
but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .	1
it is crystal clear .	1
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great .	1
but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything .	0
"i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven 't tried the 1/4 "" sleeve yet ) ."	1
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .	1
this really is a great little phone ; . its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! .	1
looks and shape : i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool .	1
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .	1
there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it .	1
good looks	1
bottom line is that at $160 , this is an absolute steal .	1
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .	0
look at the size of it ! .	1
perfect size ! . beats the competition by leaps and bounds .	1
3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs ( why 'd u buy it then ? . ! . ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias .	0
and we definitely prefer our champ ! .	1
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .	1
not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short .	0
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .	0
as for bluetooth , no problems at all .	1
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .	1
it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot .	1
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .	0
the dvd player is fine .	1
when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .	0
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .	0
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention . . . the sound quality is excellent ! .	1
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .	1
thank you apple ! . you make fabulous products .	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .	0
the setup software did everything .	1
if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget .	1
"otherwise , this is a great "" alternative "" mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple ."	1
i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .	1
the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260 .	0
i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage .	0
doesn 't have alot of good games on it .	0
this camera is great if you 're used to a high-end slr .	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .	1
i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .	1
i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use .	1
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless .	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .	1
the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .	1
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .	1
it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .	0
reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing .	1
all-in-all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use .	1
"the only complaint i have is that the 1/4 "" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4 "" bits ."	0
they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic's and sennheisers .	1
especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .	0
all in all , not very good .	0
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .	1
5 . check traffic411 . com for la traffic on the 405 .	1
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .	0
the battery life is amazing .	1
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .	0
i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention .	0
the sound is very nice .	1
- well-backlit keypad	1
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! .	1
b . fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 . 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .	1
personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .	1
i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty .	1
2 . take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures .	1
however , in my mind , $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months .	0
all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well .	1
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .	1
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .	0
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .	1
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .	0
the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful .	0
this is ridiculous .	0
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! .	1
all the good reviews for the sd500 are true .	1
however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter .	1
as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen .	1
its compact and has rounded edges .	1
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .	0
but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2 . 1 mp camera .	1
too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! .	0
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry ! .	0
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .	1
it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .	1
but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .	1
so far the software for the pc works easily .	1
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players	0
i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes .	1
"the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting ."	1
no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications .	0
we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only .	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .	0
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .	0
again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .	1
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .	1
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .	0
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .	1
setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate .	1
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .	1
good sound -- plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable -- not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy	1
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .	1
if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design .	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .	1
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! .	1
do not buy any home version of norton anything .	0
picture and video quality is ok .	1
i recommend t-mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation .	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .	1
it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house .	1
i gave up and got a diaper decor .	0
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .	1
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .	0
+sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc . . . it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .	1
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .	1
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together .	1
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .	1
i love the features , the interface , the size ( the screen is a delight ) , the camera ( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me ) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc .	1
there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to .	0
as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears .	0
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .	1
*the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily .	0
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .	0
just the home version of norton internet/av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .	0
when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive .	1
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; . an exceptional close-up shooting capability .	1
the collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out .	0
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .	1
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .	0
despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) . . . does more than most . . . does it well . . . is dependable .	1
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .	1
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue .	0
they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware .	0
downloads are a snap and quick .	1
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .	1
like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error - it was not .	0
so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! .	1
this one has a good looking .	1
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .	1
it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket .	1
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )	1
on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem .	0
it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .	0
update ( march 2005 ) : my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby : - )	1
it takes great pictures .	1
but with a low price , comes lower quality .	0
fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .	1
the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer .	0
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .	1
it still smelled .	0
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .	1
so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all .	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .	1
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .	1
i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .	1
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .	0
the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .	1
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! .	1
there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact .	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .	1
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital . com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .	0
overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood* .	1
their customer ( www . apex digital inc . com ) service is very poor .	0
the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .	0
you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .	1
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried .	1
right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly .	0
i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the ct people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed .	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thus far ) .	1
it will not replace your high-end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots .	1
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .	0
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely .	1
silver metal case -not plastic .	1
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .	1
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 . it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .	1
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .	0
it 's easy .	1
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .	1
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .	1
this is a fantastic tool to use .	1
i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .	1
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .	1
where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ) .	0
the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good -- but i was wrong ! .	1
i have never had an odor problem ! .	1
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .	0
i never get dropped calls .	1
only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth .	0
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .	1
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .	0
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support .	1
creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices .	1
plus , if you order from amazon . com , they will exchange it for you no problem .	1
the quality is superb .	1
all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one .	1
styling/ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing .	0
even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do .	0
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .	1
it wo n 't play all of my movies .	0
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .	0
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .	1
i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone .	1
i am getting better speeds on all my web programs .	1
"the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; . even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best ."	0
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .	0
this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; . because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station -- there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there .	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .	0
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .	0
now this router is not the cheapest on the market .	0
while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets .	1
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .	1
the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .	1
really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket .	1
his is what i get for my $200 on this mp3 player ? .	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .	1
ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1 . 1 usb ) .	1
this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .	1
the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet .	0
i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .	1
solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell .	0
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .	0
- equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .	1
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .	0
i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags .	1
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .	0
i highly recommend this phone .	1

even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity .	1
unless you have an enormous music/audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs .	1
