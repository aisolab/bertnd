8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth .	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon . never knew i could love a digital camera so much .	1
with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .	1
i own this phone for about 6 months now , i have used the following features : bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook , transfer files ( movies , songs ) , i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes .	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .	1
i got it working fast enough .	1
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad	1
although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big .	1
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! . it is indeed worth nothing .	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .	1
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .	1
don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space .	0
t610 supports only midi files .	0
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .	0
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .	0
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .	0
another plus in my book , no file limits ! .	1
the dvd player does not work properly .	0
the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad .	1
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .	0
the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change .	0
i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed .	0
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .	0
it 's oval and . . . nice .	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .	1
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^	1
the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard .	1
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .	0
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .	1
my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above .	0
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .	1
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .	0
very annoying .	0
after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window .	0
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .	0
putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .	1
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records .	1
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .	0
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .	0
its nice look is also a plus .	1
i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .	0
i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail .	0
what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes ! .	1
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .	0
for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well .	1
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .	0
great camera .	1
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .	0
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .	0
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .	1
and we still love it ! .	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .	0
speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable ! .	1
for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .	1
now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems .	1
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .	0
my only significant complaint is sound quality .	0
"they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "" handle "" and ship a cd ? . -- and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails ."	0
the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated .	0
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .	1
i liked this one enough to buy another .	1
all the buttons & necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .	1
there was neither picture nor sound .	0
- included creative software is pretty poor .	0
it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .	1
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ) .	1
"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use ."	1
when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing . . . it 's tiny ! .	1
i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality .	1
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .	1
there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .	1
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck	0
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .	0
the image quality is excellent .	1
there are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be text ed to you at no cost .	1
battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times . . . the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .	1
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .	0
the bass treble the sound detail is aw some .	1
compatibility with other devices is excellent too ; . i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with *anyone 's* mixed mode ) .	1
it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .	1
its stable , so a curious toddler can 't easily tip it over .	1
the storage capacity is great .	1
i have the black one and adore it .	1
"not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 "" chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping"	0
the volume .	0
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .	1
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .	0
you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .	1
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .	0
one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem .	1
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .	1
its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market .	1
the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus .	1
if you think you are saving $40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a makita .	0
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .	1
it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .	1
new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration .	1
it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .	1
i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone .	0
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .	1
i 'm really happy with this purchase .	1
now i know why - they are pieces of junk .	0
it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere .	1
"on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside ."	0
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .	1
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .	1
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .	1
the more i work with it , the more i love it ! .	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .	0
also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up .	0
the look & feel : i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance .	1
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .	1
"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . """	0
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .	0
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc . , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .	1
on my main computer the software did not work right .	0
well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more .	1
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .	1
the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .	0
2 ) scroll button / switch	0
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .	0
when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money .	1
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .	1
the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving .	1
battery life is ok .	1
the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! .	1
you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .	1
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .	1
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player .	0
the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .	1
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .	1
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it .	1
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .	0
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .	1
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .	1
it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight .	1
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .	0
so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http : //www . suavest . com/forum6 . html	1
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .	0
i am impressed with this camera inside and out .	1
"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical ."	1
. lens cap is a really annoying	0
memory/storage - seemingly boundless .	1
i highly recommend this ! .	1
overall , i am very pleased with it .	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .	0
at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! .	1
really easy to use .	1
this is a must have product for all new moms ! .	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .	1
the door would not close .	0
do n 't buy this player .	0
i would put the hitachi up with the best ! .	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .	0
2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .	1
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .	1
you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .	1
i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time ! .	0
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .	0
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .	0
the size of the camera is perfect .	1
i forgot , the case does n 't fit .	0
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .	0
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .	1
so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? . size[+2]	1
i upgraded from a very small 3 . 2 max camera to this camera with great results .	1
this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .	1
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .	1
installation was as near automatic as can be .	1
at 128 the songs sound very good .	1
finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier .	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .	1
"unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition ."	1
but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes .	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .	1
outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at&t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .	1
but the major problem i had was with the software .	0
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .	1
the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .	0
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .	1
on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative .	0
even with the waterproof housing it is small .	1
by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .	1
it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .	1
my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag .	0
1- small .	1
hate to wait between shots	1
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .	1
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds .	1
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .	0
my first impression was positive .	1
i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue .	1
but for what i do use it is perfect .	1
some adjustments in the settings could help make it better .	0
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )	0
3 . bags are easy to change .	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! .	1
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .	1
one complaint . . . the screen is too easily scratched ! .	0
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .	1
"if you have an older version of "" internet security "" installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install ."	0
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .	1
it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .	0
2 ) phone is awfully slow .	0
the camera res ponce is very quick .	1
it is hot enough to be annoying .	0
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .	0
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .	1
the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad .	0
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .	0
the battery is removable .	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player .	1
"we tried the "" finding memo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason ."	0
definitely a great camera .	1
it films 10 second video , for crying out loud .	1
first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software .	1
the touch pad is over-sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive .	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .	1
it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography .	1
the manual is excellent .	1
the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 . 11b speeds and not 802 . 11g .	0
then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely .	0
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .	1
feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player ; . equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore .	1
the storage capacity is great for me --	1
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; .	1
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .	1
the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it .	1
i do give create to creative for their attractive design .	1
) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .	1
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .	0
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .	1
to set up the box , wap , and ether nest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins .	1
this model appears to be especially good .	1
when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental .	1
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .	1
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .	1
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .	0
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .	1
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .	1
even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! .	1
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera .	1
the phone is very light weight .	1
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )	1
"the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . ."	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .	0
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .	1
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .	0
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .	1
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .	1
t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .	1
yes , the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem .	1
it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .	1
nokia does not disappoint in this model .	1
you need the software to actually transfer files	0
to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem .	0
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .	1
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .	1
although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better .	0
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .	1
one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .	0
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .	0
"there 's even an equalizer ( under "" settings "" ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , "" deep "" , and electronic ."	1
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; . it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names ; . you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc . ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .	0
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .	0
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .	0
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .	1
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .	1
everything i wanted ! . the apple ipod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason .	1
weak points : - touch pad : design could be better - volume control : controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick .	0
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .	1
the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .	0
i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well .	1
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .	0
"at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well ."	0
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .	1
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! .	1
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .	1
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .	1
t-mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate .	0
this is the best phone i have seen .	1
the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .	1
takes excellent photos .	1
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .	1
very simple and painless .	1
even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys .	1
i also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .	1
"4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "" other than phone "" functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done ."	0
3660 had similar features , but that is big in size .	1
it looks great - and is loaded with features .	1
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .	0
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .	0
1 . your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism .	0
no in box accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope . . . moveable parts -- this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; . with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; . note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium .	0
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual .	1
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .	1
it is n 't big and offensive , though you would n 't know it by looking at the pics it takes .	1
i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .	1
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .	1
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .	1
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .	0
with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive .	1
but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100 .	1
i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions .	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .	1
after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine .	1
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! .	0
the panorama modes are wonderful .	1
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .	1
the in ital setup of the router was simple .	1
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod's dirty secret . com .	1
as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains .	1
i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result . . . junk software .	0
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller .	1
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .	0
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .	1
i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .	1
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .	1
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr / cadre / dvd / dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the giff , progressive scan feature .	1
in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .	1
another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging[-2]	0
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .	1
about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .	0
i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $300 systematic because he saw what this router can do .	1
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .	0
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .	0
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .	1
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual .	1
great quality picture and features .	1
i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .	1
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .	0
opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .	0
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! .	0
i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up .	0
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .	1
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .	0
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .	0
i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! .	1
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .	0
we 've never experienced odor from the pail .	1
in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece .	0
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .	0
frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used .	1
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .	1
i 've had nothing but good luck with t-mobile .	1
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .	1
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .	1
i also love that you can flip the device with one hand . . .	1
fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .	1
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .	1
"i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the "" mixed mode "" feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router ."	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .	0
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .	1
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .	0
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	1
"difficult navigation - i wo n 't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate ."	0
the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple .	0
i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it .	1
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .	1
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .	0
after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out .	0
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! .	0
my son tried it and he too couldn 't change the speed without an assist .	0
1 . the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find ! .	1
door broke after a month .	0
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all	1
we are overall pleased with product .	1
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc .	1
it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ? .	0
my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic .	1
the service from t-mobile is very good too .	1
the diaper champ is the best ! .	1
this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .	0
i love this camera .	1
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .	0
this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .	1
the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit .	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .	0
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; . this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .	0
nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price	1
5- excelent software package .	1
all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .	1
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .	1
i 'd say that this camera is perfect .	1
the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! . ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e . g . covers of songs ) , etc .	1
this phone is a winner . . .	1
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .	1
i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut .	1
i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router .	0
the moveable lcd screen is great .	1
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .	1
there is no odor and it is very easy to use .	1
and it holds so much music and audio files .	1
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; . it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 . 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! .	1
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .	1
even the instruction booklet is out of order .	0
the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10% or so .	0
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .	1
a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering .	1
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .	1
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .	1
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .	1
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .	1
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .	1
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself .	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc . , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .	1
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast .	0
it definitely keeps the smell out .	1
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .	1
i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )	1
it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow .	1
ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone i have owned .	1
it also holds a lot more diapers .	1
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .	1
1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players .	1
i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone .	0
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking	0
even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .	1
hard drive screws up occasionally	0
the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot .	1
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .	1
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .	1
mediasource did not recognize my tags ! .	0
it doesn 't bog down under load .	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .	1
have had problems since the first day	0
) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors . .	1
however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .	0
you 'll love it ! .	1
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .	1
the diaper champ is the best we found ! .	1
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .	1
"update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it ! ."	1
all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional .	0
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .	1
if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .	0
the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full .	0
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .	0
- solid , high-quality construction	1
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .	1
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .	1
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .	0
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident .	0
the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .	1
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .	1
i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better .	0
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .	1
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .	1
utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list .	1
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .	1
the included memory card is too small .	0
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 .	1
1 . pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .	0
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .	1
the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks .	0
the interface works great .	1
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .	0
im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .	0
i didnt have any installation problems ; . and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate .	1
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .	1
the height adjustment works well- not perfect .	1
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .	1
its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it .	1
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet .	1
it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .	1
also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you .	1
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc .	1
sound : this is where i love zen the most .	1
this thing is trash .	0
i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus ! .	1
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38 ; . phone lying by your pillow side .	1
i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .	0
fact is , it could n 't be easier to use .	1
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .	0
the battery life on this phone is surreal .	1
remember , this phone uses an operating system - symbian . . . and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k colors .	1
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; . the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .	1
great colors , pictures and white balance .	1
3 ) 4x zoom is nice	1
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .	1
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc . ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .	0
but , for the money it is a good machine .	1
i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this .	1
most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery .	1
now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full .	0
it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges .	1
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .	0
