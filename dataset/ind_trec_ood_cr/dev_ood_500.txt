- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .	0
00% good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks .	0
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support .	1
most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery .	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .	0
"the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting ."	1
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .	1
look at the size of it ! .	1
if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else .	1
the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed .	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .	1
we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $6 . 00 for a year of bags- can 't beat that ! . ! .	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones .	1
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well .	1
the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately .	0
no matter the format .	1
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .	1
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .	1
so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand .	1
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .	0
i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it .	0
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )	0
honestly , i love this player .	1
the diaper champ is the best ! .	1
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .	1
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	0
this model appears to be especially good .	1
but with a low price , comes lower quality .	0
t-mobile was a pretty good server .	1
update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! .	0
fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .	1
secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .	0
good looks	1
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .	0
i 'd give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .	1
the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .	1
you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .	1
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .	1
the battery life is amazing .	1
"also included in the "" games "" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs ."	1
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	1
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful .	1
the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent .	1
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect .	0
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .	1
and the battery life is bad ! .	0
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; . it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 . 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! .	1
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .	1
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .	1
styling/ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing .	0
the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving .	1
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of usb wires .	1
i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked ! .	0
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .	1
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing .	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .	0
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .	1
if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading	1
fm radio built in ( howard stern ) .	1
i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked .	0
yes , i recommend it over the competition .	1
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive .	1
bluetooth does not work on this phone .	0
"also , when i dial an "" 800 "" number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu ."	0
verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game .	0
my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long .	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .	1
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .	0
i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits .	0
have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t-mobile .	1
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .	1
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .	1
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .	0
the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having .	0
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand/hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) .	1
"the only complaint i have is that the 1/4 "" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4 "" bits ."	0
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .	1
its nice look is also a plus .	1
since then , i have not found one major problem with it .	1
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .	1
( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell . even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see-through ? . ) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full .	0
but for what i do use it is perfect .	1
i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .	1
1 ) it is perhaps too small .	0
to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem .	0
for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy .	1
you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .	1
excellent sound i mean the player has juice .	1
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .	1
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you .	1
the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17 .	0
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .	1
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas .	0
give each friend a different ringtone .	1
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! .	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .	1
i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100 , and of course i got the latter ! .	1
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .	1
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .	0
it 's good .	1
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad	1
"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical ."	1
"the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead ."	0
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .	1
and we still love it ! .	1
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc .	1
i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .	0
and amazon . com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? .	1
it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break .	1
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly .	1
when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck ! .	0
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .	1
i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy .	1
i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention .	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .	1
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .	0
especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .	0
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .	0
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .	1
creative labs customer support website is useless .	0
remember , this phone uses an operating system - symbian . . . and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k colors .	1
only con i can think of is no camera . . . .	0
great camera .	1
it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .	0
there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .	1
"seems the "" program scan "" feature did not find the exe file for outlook ! ."	0
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely .	1
1 . record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro .	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .	1
+battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality . . . i mean it is creative right ? .	1
6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic .	1
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .	1
battery life is ok .	1
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .	1
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .	1
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .	0
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together .	1
only one disk played through to completion successfully .	0
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .	1
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .	0
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .	0
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .	1
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .	1
the look & feel : i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance .	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .	1
i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face .	1
overall , i am very pleased with it .	1
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .	0
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .	1
for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .	1
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .	0
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n 't moving in time to the dialog ) .	0
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .	0
especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around .	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .	1
as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep .	1
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .	1
the battery life can 't be very long ; . let 's not be greedy .	0
the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated .	0
"on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside ."	0
i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected ! . ) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it .	0
best phone i 've ever owned , period .	1
"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . """	0
it doesn 't bog down under load .	1
no way to contact their customer service .	0
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .	0
freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful .	1
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller .	1
i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help .	0
only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .	0
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless .	1
it still smelled .	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .	1
it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .	1
this camera is bulletproof .	1
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .	1
i never get dropped calls .	1
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .	1
downside : it takes a long time to start up .	0
ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone i have owned .	1
aside from a 6mb++ built-in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it ! .	1
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .	1
and it is extremely well-priced for what you 're getting .	1
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! .	1
and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .	1
that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism .	0
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .	0
it has plenty of power .	1
opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .	0
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .	1
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it .	1
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .	0
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .	1
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .	1
buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .	0
also , the instruction manual is very bad .	0
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .	1
the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated .	1
if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .	1
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera .	1
recently the variable speed control went out .	0
this player seems to work fine with everything else .	1
the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot .	1
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .	0
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .	1
also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs .	0
1 ) great audio quality overall .	1
apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini .	0
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .	0
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face .	0
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .	0
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome .	1
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .	0
other than that , i think it is the best router for the money .	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! .	1
i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt . com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps/directions into it , which is great .	1
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .	0
this phone is one of the best i 've ever used .	1
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )	1
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! .	1
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .	1
on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative .	0
it takes great pictures .	1
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .	1
once again it won 't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians .	0
unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .	1
personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .	1
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .	1
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .	0
i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine .	1
i love the quality of the pictures .	1
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .	0
absolutely no problems with this router .	1
8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth .	1
the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area .	0
love the speaker phone .	1
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .	0
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .	0
i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time .	0
sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good .	1
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .	0
go for the champ .	1
they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed ! .	0
other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either .	1
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .	0
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .	0
his is what i get for my $200 on this mp3 player ? .	0
the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject .	0
i 'd say that this camera is perfect .	1
even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life ! .	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .	1
the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus .	1
no memory stick slots -- although a rare feature , it would be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built-in lithium battery -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; . draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient	0
there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .	1
2 . you still have to clean the thing ! . ! .	0
i didnt have any installation problems ; . and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate .	1
it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere .	1
5 stars all the way ! .	1
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .	1
it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house .	1
the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .	1
and it is very easy to clean .	1
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .	1
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .	1
) creative , inc . the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices .	0
"the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; . even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best ."	0
great sound ; . good interface ; . replaceable , powerful battery ; . good software ; . wake-up , sleep timers ; . multiple play modes	1
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .	1
the router works fine for both wired and wireless .	1
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! .	1
sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application .	0
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .	0
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .	1
made the camera totally inoperable .	0
the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad .	1
stay away from this product ! .	0
i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic ) .	1
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .	1
the installation software cd crashed repeatedly .	0
i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! .	1
there is no odor and it is very easy to use .	1
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .	1
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .	1
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .	1
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .	0
it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! . ) .	1
it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .	1
well , my second one is now beginning to hi cup a bit after about 1 1/2 years .	0
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .	1
the interface is simple to use .	1
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .	0
the bass treble the sound detail is aw some .	1
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .	0
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .	0
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .	0
i 'm really happy with this purchase .	1
there was neither picture nor sound .	0
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .	1
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .	0
2 . take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures .	1
if you use linux and want gr ps and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you .	1
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .	0
i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while .	0
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .	0
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .	0
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .	0
the image quality is excellent .	1
there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .	1
the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection .	0
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast .	0
i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills .	1
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .	1
sound : this is where i love zen the most .	1
even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! .	1
-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n 't always accurate .	0
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .	1
you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .	1
i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did .	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .	1
this is a wonderful camera .	1
pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set .	1
i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances .	1
i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .	1
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet .	1
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .	0
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .	1
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .	1
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .	1
i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra . . . and i was not disappointed .	1
"very good "" every day "" camera . fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos ."	1
2 ) scroll button / switch	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .	1
and the video quality is amazing .	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! .	1
"as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "" plunger "" to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full ."	0
creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .	1
"i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse ."	0
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 . 0 .	1
it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .	1
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .	1
the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use .	0
takes excellent photos .	1
"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use ."	1
do not buy any home version of norton anything .	0
again , this is a design flaw in the headphone ! .	0
if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $15 dollars i think ) .	1
this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example .	1
i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down .	1
the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym .	1
* eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files .	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly .	1
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .	0
the buttons are rather stiff .	0
it was also the most appealing .	1
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches .	0
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .	1
have a great and easy to use bundled software	1
the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .	0
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .	1
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .	0
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr / cadre / dvd / dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the giff , progressive scan feature .	1
3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs ( why 'd u buy it then ? . ! . ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias .	0
so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? . size[+2]	1
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .	1
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .	1
start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .	0
the phone itself is pretty nice .	1
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .	0
( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked .	0
very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures .	1
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .	1
the quality is superb .	1
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . .	1
this phone is a winner . . .	1
digital zoom is clear too . . . say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then . . . just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture	1
the dvd player does not work properly .	0
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . )	1
let the champ win you over ! .	1
i got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .	1
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .	0
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .	1
whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! .	1
the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well .	0
1 . pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .	0
everything i wanted ! . the apple ipod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason .	1
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .	1
when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage .	1
although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall .	0
"not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 "" chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping"	0
you indefinitely appreciate the small size .	1
the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration .	1
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .	1
the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend .	0
the storage capacity is great .	1
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .	1
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift .	0
utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list .	1
this makes for a great phone .	1
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .	1
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .	0
the powershot g3 is a great camera .	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --	0
i 've had no problems w/ this phone .	1
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .	1
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .	0
now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems .	1
10 great price for all the features .	1
the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260 .	0
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .	0
this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )	0
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .	1
i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .	0
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .	0
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .	1
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .	1
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .	1
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .	1
outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at&t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .	1
it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired pc or a wireless equipped pc .	0
t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .	1
there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows .	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .	1
ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .	1
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! .	1
i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .	1
i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors .	1
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .	0
four megapixels is great .	1
it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever .	1
i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .	1
"the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make . . ."	1
the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .	1
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .	1
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .	0
it has everything i needed : bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a good operating system with lots of supporting software .	1
i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons .	1
for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player .	1
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .	1
the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost .	0
it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .	1
it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .	1
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .	1
i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time ! .	0
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .	1
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .	0
some dvd 's i rented would not play .	0
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .	1
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .	0
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .	1
i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone .	1
the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp .	1
iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed .	0
the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription ! .	1
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .	1
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .	1
way to go apple ! .	1
after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ) .	0
nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price	1
this one is really great .	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n 't take weeks to figure out how to operate .	1
i tried the cd setup program without any luck .	0
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on	0
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .	1
so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .	0
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .	1
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .	0
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .	1
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .	1
the diaper champ is the best we found ! .	1
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .	0
even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up .	0
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive .	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .	1
also , not liking the gel case .	0
silver metal case -not plastic .	1
there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it .	1
this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .	0
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .	1
fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd	1
