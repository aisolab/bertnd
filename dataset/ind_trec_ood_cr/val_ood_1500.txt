the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! .	1
) -can 't be left in the car . . . it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long .	0
original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great ! .	1
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .	1
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .	0
but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is . . . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer .	0
so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! .	0
the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .	0
i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills .	1
it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up .	1
in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep .	1
so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? . ? . ? . this seems academic to me .	0
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .	1
i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it .	0
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work .	0
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .	0
just point and shoot and the photos were great .	1
a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet .	0
it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon .	1
- replaceable battery .	1
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .	1
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .	0
the camera is adequate and if i want high-res photos i 'll use my digital camera instead .	1
there is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features .	1
when talking the voice is not very clear .	0
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .	1
great camera , great investment ! .	1
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .	1
i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability .	1
but not good enough for me .	0
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .	1
this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it .	1
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .	0
this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .	1
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .	0
i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool .	1
its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus .	1
i had no problems following their installation instructions .	1
controls are a bit awkward .	0
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .	1
mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti-virus 2002 & personal firewall 2002 first ) .	1
the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so .	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .	1
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly .	0
software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it , it does the job well .	0
( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )	1
the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .	1
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good .	1
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use .	1
the screen is clear and readable , and the touch pad works very well , it took me less than a day to get the hang of it , and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control .	1
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .	1
the interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus .	1
the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .	1
downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .	0
also , with one click you can help train your spam killer .	1
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .	1
i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy .	0
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .	1
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .	0
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .	0
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .	1
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .	0
the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness .	1
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .	1
we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .	1
when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .	0
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .	1
as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market .	1
other than that it is all the same except the new updates .	0
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .	1
there is no odor and extremely easy to use .	1
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .	1
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .	1
"there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "" knowledge "" database at linksys . com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult -- that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own ."	0
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . .	1
- excellent sound quality	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .	1
i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever .	1
finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost/gb , and also consider ease of use .	1
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .	1
itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site .	1
but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener .	0
the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will .	0
the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly ) .	1
and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3/smtp e-mail account .	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .	0
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; . see below ) .	1
"while i have not had the "" privilege "" , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones ."	1
built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes .	1
photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one . . even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )	1
just too numerous to list : fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two .	0
comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router .	1
the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast ! .	1
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .	1
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .	0
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .	0
the user support service isn 't too great either .	0
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .	1
it 's such a great camera ! . i think it really was worth the investment = )	1
i love the es based controls and easy menus .	1
this is a great camera for you ! .	1
the light auto-correction is awesome .	1
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .	0
we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great .	1
the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all .	1
i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .	0
all in all , this is a great phone .	1
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .	1
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( flor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them . the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .	0
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .	1
the player is smaller than you think .	1
i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location .	0
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .	1
the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding .	0
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .	0
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .	1
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .	0
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority .	0
also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston .	0
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .	0
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .	0
*holds the odor in nicely ! .	1
3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files .	0
it 's faster than wmp .	1
placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect .	1
with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long .	1
this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine .	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n 't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .	0
the g3 looks like a work of art ! .	1
in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .	0
the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use .	1
you just can 't go wrong with this one ! .	1
it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcgee anti-virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems .	1
it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish .	1
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .	1
another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up .	0
from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .	1
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! . ! . ! .	1
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .	1
so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .	1
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .	0
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini .	1
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .	0
navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .	0
overall i like the unit .	1
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with .	0
this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing .	0
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive	0
great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? . ) . . . the 2 . 0 megapixel one ) .	1
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance .	0
usb 2 . 0 transfer is insanely fast .	1
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .	0
i have an ipod and it is a great buy .	1
the product also leaves a faint smell in the room .	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! .	1
this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi-tech casing .	1
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .	1
these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable .	1
and supply those stupid white headphones .	0
- not compatible with audible . com books .	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .	1
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since .	0
you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu .	0
the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate .	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .	1
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up .	1
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .	0
it 's far better than all others on the market .	1
i love it ! . ! .	1
the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones .	0
each battery lasts about 10-11 hours .	1
after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .	1
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .	0
broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies .	1
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .	0
it has a nice color screen .	1
the menus are easy to scroll through ; . they are laid out naturally , and make sense .	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .	1
this is the mp3 player with everything i need . as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied .	1
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .	1
a wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose ! . ! . ! .	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .	1
p . s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? .	0
i would however highly recommend the m12v router ! .	1
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .	1
only problem is that is a bit heavy .	0
no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .	1
once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor ) .	1
in addition it is very easy to setup .	1
c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said	0
the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere .	1
otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits .	0
i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues .	0
the ss body is wonderful , feels high-quality .	1
( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare -- and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag .	1
also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast .	1
the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent .	1
the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately .	0
i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality .	1
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .	1
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .	1
because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery .	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .	1
the only reason for not giving it 5 stars : the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6-8 hours at most .	0
the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great ( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good ) .	1
i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! . ! . ! .	1
im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )	1
the remote is a little hard to understand .	0
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing .	0
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .	0
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .	0
and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .	1
"getting the router setup in a "" vanilla "" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem ."	1
i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .	1
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .	0
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .	0
we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags .	1
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips .	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! .	1
bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck ! .	1
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .	0
2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception .	1
i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .	1
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .	0
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .	1
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .	1
the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap .	1
but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers .	1
audio on video also lacking .	0
i haven 't tried to set up any advanced features on the router , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use .	1
first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $300 myself .	0
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually .	0
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .	0
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .	1
the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are : one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well .	0
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .	0
i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks .	1
handsfree future is good , but not too exciting .	1
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .	1
i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views .	1
not a killer problem , but not well done , either .	0
configuring it for a home network was almost impossible .	0
i can 't smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby ) .	1
it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70% of my calls using it .	0
i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .	1
2 . the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .	0
if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to .	0
this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38 ; . very convenient to scroll in menu etc .	1
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser .	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .	1
it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills .	1
the included software removes any red eye easily .	1
if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version .	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .	0
has a great helpline .	1
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .	1
the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight .	0
the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .	1
the features are really cool like the radio .	1
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end .	0
this thing plays everything i feed it .	1
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .	0
it was a symantec error .	0
the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program --	1
the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .	0
norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer .	0
many of our disney movies do n 't play on this dvd player .	0
i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far .	1
i never had a single problem .	1
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .	1
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .	1
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .	0
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else's is too .	0
this product is absolutely not ready for release .	0
as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems .	1
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .	0
there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't .	0
the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect .	1
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; . you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .	0
my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now .	1
the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera .	1
size - bigger than the ipod	0
the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly .	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )	0
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www . crazy cellphone . com	1
on the t-mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a t-mobile tone ( usually a major city ) .	1
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .	0
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )	0
my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful .	0
the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones .	1
"the card basically installed itself and the "" install wizard "" on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) ."	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .	1
i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .	1
3 ) user replaceable battery	1
many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well .	0
bottom line . . . great product , unbeatable price .	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .	1
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .	1
sometimes , various applications crash .	0
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .	1
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .	0
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .	1
it 's worth it .	1
it fits in your pocket .	1
"can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me ."	0
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .	0
- great sound ! . i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones .	1
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n 't the only one this happened to . )	0
all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price .	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .	0
using supplied s/w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it .	1
however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes .	1
and man . . . i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player . . . because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title . .	0
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .	0
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .	1
"i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required "" permissions "" and lacked proper administrator status ."	0
the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can .	0
the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone	1
i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa .	0
many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks .	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .	1
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .	1
i like the size and shape .	1
the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .	1
all in all it hasn 't been a bad product .	1
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .	0
clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! . ! . ! .	1
it was no problem for me to use their software .	1
luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger .	0
mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars ) .	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .	1
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .	1
i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended .	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod .	1
it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon ) .	1
enjoy .	1
that is , you can not access the internet at all .	0
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .	1
after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while .	0
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .	0
- outstanding signal reception	1
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over ( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back ) .	0
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .	1
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .	1
overall i 'm incredibly impressed with my new zen touch .	1
as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .	1
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured ; . basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders .	0
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .	1
a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .	1
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there :	0
two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well .	0
other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them ,	0
anti-spam is good	1
such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in . . . wrong ! .	0
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .	1
among my requirements for a phone were : good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support .	1
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary .	1
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; . it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .	1
it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside .	1
the songs do n 't play one after another like on a cd .	0
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n 't load on some computers .	0
the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk .	1
one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like .	0
drops and strong signals even from the backyard .	1
that 's a rare and valuable feature .	1
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .	1
the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating .	1
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely ! .	0
the radio feature has superb sound quality .	1
it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs . com for more on that ) .	1
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .	1
my case doesnt close . . . maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .	0
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .	1
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .	1
little to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues .	0
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .	1
it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use .	1
this product has virtually all the same installation problems .	0
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .	1
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .	1
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .	1
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )	0
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! .	1
operation : it 's like bmw 's i-drive - it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly-layered interface .	0
the new canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the s100 .	1
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .	1
i love the storage in this thing .	1
audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions .	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n 't since with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc . like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .	0
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .	1
i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again .	1
they really are awfully small .	0
i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers .	1
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course	0
first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor .	1
"the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don 't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "" enter "" key , but you get used to it and it isn 't a big deal ."	0
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .	0
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .	1
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory .	0
4 . play n-gage games on it .	1
colors : 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from .	1
the panorama setting is unbelievable ! .	1
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .	1
i purchased two of these beauties .	1
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .	1
i love my new nomad , its great ! .	1
overall , i 've been very impressed with the player .	1
it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003 .	1
who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95 ? . ( i also bought the back-up cd ) .	0
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .	0
i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective .	0
the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it .	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .	1
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc .	1
i dont use the belt clip cz it fails to hold the player securely ( design problem ) .	0
the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute .	1
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .	1
the phones are awesome .	1
they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! .	1
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! .	1
i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone .	0
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .	1
i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned .	1
"unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . """	0
it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .	1
booting up my computer took forever ! . ! . ! .	0
7 . have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone .	1
it is small .	1
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .	1
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .	0
all at the same time , and all without a hitch .	1
what a disappointment ! .	0
* main dial is not backlit .	0
get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! .	1
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net .	1
the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un-soiled they are .	0
first off , the battery .	0
the pictures are a little dark sometimes .	0
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .	0
what a junk .	0
for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .	0
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .	1
this camera is so easy to use ! .	1
"even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! . shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" ."	1
i use it on a router table , and it is works well .	1
so , right out of the box i had issue .	0
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all .	1
what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has .	1
it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music .	0
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .	0
i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers . . . not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc .	0
the gprs web access is slow ! .	0
7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal .	1
at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated .	0
the sound from the player is ok .	1
much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .	1
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens .	0
problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad .	0
- bright , visible screen	1
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .	1
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .	1
my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones .	0
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task .	0
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches .	0
anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants .	0
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .	1
the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers .	1
this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation .	1
this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .	0
i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio & samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro .	1
it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well .	1
1 . creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; . but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; . 3 , 400 tracks ; . 12 . 5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? .	0
i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks ! .	1
the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .	1
6600 looks and feels nice .	1
( you can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby . ) also , we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the diaper genie ) .	1
hold button -- suprisingly not all mp3s have this ; . this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket .	1
it has it all .	1
4 . the build is just right .	1
it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow .	0
- speakerphone	1
it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .	1
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable .	1
apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs $100 ! .	0
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .	1
3 . the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .	1
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on . . . literally ! .	1
if you need a wireless router . . . . get it get it get it . . . . works really good . . . .	1
n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc .	1
thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place .	1
i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes .	0
i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window .	0
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .	0
these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .	1
the customer support is pathetic .	0
really happy with this little camera .	1
holy cow ! . it really does scratch easily ! .	0
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .	1
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! .	1
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .	1
because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .	0
i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .	1
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me .	1
"i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler ."	0
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .	1
it was n 't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .	0
basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help .	0
i went out and got the canon today .	1
this one is full of features ( has bluetooth ) .	1
"seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , "" no disc "" ."	0
this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .	1
the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken .	0
the photo quality is amazing .	1
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .	1
now the bad : 1 ) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usu age .	0
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .	1
"for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the caribbean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it ."	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .	1
songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .	1
best in class .	1
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .	0
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .	1
* price and capacity	1
it also has unproven battery life .	0
"when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn "" t work either ! ."	0
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings .	1
p . s . the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port . the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power ; . after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly .	0
i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non-tech customer service ( tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzak ) or they have a $30 tech-support number .	0
the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network .	0
the battery , as others have said , also seems weaker than creative suggests .	0
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .	1
the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder .	0
i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155 .	1
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder .	1
it works great .	1
unfortunately , the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it .	0
the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem .	0
"i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "" sliding wrench "" which comes on the router ."	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .	1
its really cool .	1
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .	1
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .	1
the player is great .	1
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .	1
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .	1
it does take some getting used to .	0
the great and versatile ipod	1
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems .	1
also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable .	0
it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black .	1
two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .	1
the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over .	1
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! .	1
the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out .	1
if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice .	1
i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e ! .	1
software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )	1
i am bored with the silver look .	0
software - the software is crap .	0
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .	1
i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable .	1
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .	0
i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating .	0
simple to use and hook up .	1
upside : this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ) .	1
well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! .	1
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .	0
very cool features . . . great camera with zoom . . . cool quality pictures . . . great ringtones . . . bluetooth feature is great . . . .	1
is not as intuitive as i would like .	0
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .	1
* i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable .	0
overall build quality , good macros-results , impressive video-quality , good pictures with flash ( good colours , sharp results ) , excellent auto white balance .	1
"it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a "" normal "" compression mode . and , it has the 3x zoom ."	1
the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways .	1
the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder .	1
and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 . 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge .	1
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .	0
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .	0
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .	1
this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope .	0
they last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start .	0
it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves .	0
transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy .	1
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used .	1
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .	0
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .	1
i mean , they 're short ! .	0
- no proprietary headset jack	0
creative software stinks .	0
the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch .	1
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .	1
exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .	1
however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every-day use .	0
this product is way cooler than anything ive used before ( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone ) .	1
in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .	0
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .	1
i love the performance and features of this router .	1
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .	0
the menus are very easy to navigate .	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .	1
- light , compact design	1
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price	1
for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that .	0
for the money apex machines have good features .	1
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other niceties , that you would enjoy .	1
i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years .	1
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players .	1
it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it .	0
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! .	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .	1
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .	0
the prints are beautiful ! .	1
it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack . . . char ! .	1
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks .	0
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed	1
3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have .	0
these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one .	1
the touch pad does take a little getting used to .	0
feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there .	1
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .	1
this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat .	1
i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit .	1
as for the zen micro : \ cons : i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front .	0
however , i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec .	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .	0
i can only hear the sound but no picture ! .	0
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .	1
i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .	1
good quality video .	1
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .	1
the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .	0
i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played .	0
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n 't break down like the reviews i 've read .	1
the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value .	0
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .	1
high quality video and pictures rock ! .	1
the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod .	1
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .	1
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! .	1
it would not hang up on calls .	0
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .	1
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .	1
diaper champ is great .	1
the first one would n 't work from the start .	0
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .	1
the movie mode is also working great .	1
the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .	1
compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .	1
i can not find a carrier for this phone i like , end up just tossing it in my purse .	0
an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook .	1
unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation .	0
simple and it works ! .	1
in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes ) .	1
the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days .	1
( it sure does look nice , though ! . ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere : the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge ! .	1
the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market .	1
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .	0
games -- not really important , but exist ant	1
"some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "" the bar of soap "" which , it really is ."	0
one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .	1
imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .	0
this is a well-made and powerful tool .	1
i think the interface is great .	1
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it .	1
if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w/ the diaper genie .	1
the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it .	1
first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made .	0
- best in class sound	1
i downloaded this set from norton , and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download .	0
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone .	1
the accessories that come with the player are great .	1
it 's not my first choice in cameras ,	0
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectors s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )	0
namely , it wouldnt sync .	0
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll / push button .	1
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )	1
- uploading music is quick and easy .	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .	1
it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .	1
right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .	1
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .	1
1 . the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer .	1
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .	0
"we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work "" apex "" dvd players and none worked ."	0
durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .	0
i am very pleased with it so far .	1
overall , this router seems like a reasonably priced product th ! .	1
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .	0
and also , it 's priced very afford ably .	1
they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great .	1
they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .	0
if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one .	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .	0
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .	1
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support .	0
as said before this works perfectly .	1
i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless-g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product .	1
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .	0
first , it really is tiny ; . the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper .	1
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .	1
to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc .	0
after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings .	0
this phone has many other features , ir , ; . just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .	1
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n 't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .	0
4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away .	0
battery : a big big plus .	1
also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls .	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .	1
i 've since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! . ! . ! .	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .	0
at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph .	1
advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable .	1
4 ) usb 2 . 0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! . ) .	1
the dvd player just would 't recognize them .	0
great phone , i 'd buy another .	1
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .	1
the software you get with this camera is perfect .	1
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .	1
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .	0
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .	0
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .	1
it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable .	1
"the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie "" extras "" on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that ."	0
the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up .	1
if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen .	1
so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work .	0
regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go .	1
"the computer interface is 90% good , only losing points due to the fact that "" creative "" branding is all over the place within it ."	1
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .	1
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .	1
the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don 't have a nice click .	0
the software is great .	1
i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it .	1
the touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want .	0
the battery does not last 12 hours .	0
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone .	1
apex does n 't answer the phone .	0
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .	1
we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it .	1
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .	1
no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find ! .	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .	1
buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny .	0
the champ works great .	1
( . . . ) like most soho routers , it has nearly non-existant logging .	0
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .	0
the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .	1
however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro .	1
the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp ) .	1
i will never buy a creative product again .	0
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung .	0
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .	0
i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and saw no improvement .	0
most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options . . . like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing .	0
very simple to use .	1
after @ 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds .	0
it looks sleek and modern .	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .	0
it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram ) .	0
it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too .	1
3 . the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface .	1
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .	1
as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast . . . about one or two seconds per song .	1
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . . .	1
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .	0
the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob .	0
3 . it never smelled - at all .	1
"for a sleeker , smaller and more "" average "" mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful ."	1
- the cover that came with it did n 't fit very well	0
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .	1
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .	0
i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it .	1
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .	0
- audio formats : supports both mp3 , wma . . . and yeah , wav too .	1
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .	0
we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail ! .	1
for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .	1
but the product is elf is great .	1
the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen .	1
but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function .	0
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! .	1
the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function .	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .	1
they obviously have quality and reliability problems .	0
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .	0
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .	1
it works great .	1
you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right .	0
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .	1
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .	0
c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .	1
on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again .	1
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .	0
will never purchase apex again .	0
it comes with a good case that fits it snugly .	1
now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again .	0
it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review .	1
as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage .	0
"1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers ."	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features .	1
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .	1
i 'm currently using a sony vaio s-150 ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely .	0
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .	1
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .	0
with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid .	1
the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .	1
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works .	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .	0
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .	1
the general button placement is not very user friendly .	0
its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset .	1
and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills .	1
i like the speak phone function a lot .	1
record memos using the built in microphone .	1
"less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . """	0
have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .	0
the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy = good , but it 's always hard to tell these days ) .	1
smooth plunging mechanism .	1
cuts are easy and smooth .	1
it is made of plastic .	0
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .	0
although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there .	0
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .	0
i love the touchpaper controls .	1
nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .	0
the startup time , quality of pictures and videos is outstanding .	1
if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else .	0
maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it .	0
the software sucks .	0
everything shines of quality .	1
i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho . . . not compatible with xp	0
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .	0
this phone has the best battery , it lasts longer then my old 3210	1
everything else about the camera is great .	1
if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! . the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .	0
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i . e . free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps / games .	1
"we constantly got "" windows virtual memory low "" error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes ."	0
i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt .	0
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .	0
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book ! .	1
very bad quality .	0
overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .	1
it 's so cute . . . and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue .	1
i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever .	1
don 't buy the diaper champ .	0
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .	1
- the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people . -	0
i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router .	1
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .	0
and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .	1
the blue backlight is pretty cool .	1
you must keep double checking depths .	0
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .	1
i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection .	0
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! .	1
i love all of the features , and presets as well .	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .	1
loved the slim design .	1
why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? . ? . ? .	0
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .	1
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .	0
i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i 've found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone .	1
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .	1
i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on .	0
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .	1
for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit .	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .	1
also , it was only $ 39 . 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .	1
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .	1
smooth plunging ! . ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w/ lubricant .	1
ease of use/design : the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one .	1
then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not .	0
in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution .	1
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything . . . good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .	1
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .	0
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n 't be any easier .	1
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .	1
if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer .	1
4 ) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying .	0
i really love this phone . . .	1
the scroll bar again takes some getting used to .	0
using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient .	1
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .	1
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal .	1
the camera was a marvel .	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .	1
i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it -- it 's size .	1
it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite .	1
the biggest problem is the installation .	0
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem .	0
"even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "" mac settings "" , etc ."	0
the radio and voice recording are nice .	1
transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .	1
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones .	1
"i rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , "" i want that one ! . "" i was willing to shell out"	1
i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use .	1
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .	1
the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures , and feels very solid .	1
of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless .	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! .	1
among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design .	0
i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .	0
what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems ! .	0
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .	1
third , the poor design continues with the case .	0
this is really a nice diaper pail .	1
i am an advanced computer user , so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work ! .	0
"it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n 't a clue why ."	0
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .	1
after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files .	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper .	1
all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price .	1
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player	1
"i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "" diaper "" trash bags necessary ."	1
creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device .	1
its quiet .	0
setup in xp was instant and intuitive .	1
well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! . ! .	1
great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ) .	1
the metal housing seems very rugged .	1
otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .	0
the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .	1
perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated . . . i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ( ? . )	1
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; . and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .	0
i really liked the price . . .	1
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .	1
"2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . """	0
"also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order ."	0
diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first .	0
the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use .	1
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today .	0
"their website had a download that helped remove those , although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the "" programs "" directory ."	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .	0
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .	0
the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great ! .	1
cons breaks easily .	0
i also did n 't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .	0
i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program .	0
it 's as though nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use .	0
i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt .	1
likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too .	1
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .	1
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .	1
you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! . ) .	1
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .	1
this is extremely lame .	0
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .	1
i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast ! .	0
but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera .	1
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .	1
their site offers no live help at all .	0
overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect .	1
by the way , it looks nice also .	1
however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn 't work at all in the car , for example .	0
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .	1
i am very pleased with my purchase .	1
supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone .	1
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .	0
this camera is truely superb .	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .	0
first , the cons . . . a tad bulky . . . not the most aesthetic looking player . . . and does n 't support a folder structure .	0
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .	1
if you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you ! .	1
"my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 "" screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 "" monitor ."	0
3 ) the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control .	1
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .	1
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .	1
it 's also easy to empty out .	1
i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! . )	1
this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great .	1
"the player kept displaying "" no disc "" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! ."	0
this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time .	1
it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .	0
the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle .	1
what i dont like : nothing much except headphones , belt clip design .	0
on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade .	1
works great ! .	1
this is really a no brain er .	1
the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck .	0
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life .	0
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack .	1
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .	1
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n 't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player . for the first three hours , and then it died .	0
this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want .	1
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .	1
the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year .	1
fm receiver - it has none .	0
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .	1
the interface took a little getting used to .	0
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .	0
it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed , doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it .	1
the depth adjustment was sloppy .	0
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .	1
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .	1
battery non-issue .	1
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones ! .	0
the sound quality is also nice . . . after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .	1
3 . play java games on it .	1
overall i 'm happy with my toy .	1
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .	0
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .	0
features : click wheel to navigate ; . ability to work with windows or mac ; . optional back lighting ( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ) ; . ability to download pda info ; . automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer .	1
"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . """	0
a bit disappoint on that ! .	0
they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t-shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons .	1
the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .	1
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .	1
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .	1
if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 . 0 .	1
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n 't do it ! .	0
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .	1
the installation , set-up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well .	1
i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .	1
dont rely on t-mobile rebates .	0
"the sound is great , the portability , etc . . . all the "" stuff "" you expect from a good mp-3 player , this zen micro has it ."	1
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! .	0
interface - practically seamless .	1
but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ? .	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie .	1
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers .	0
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .	1
"my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field ."	0
unfortunately i was wrong .	0
fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player .	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds .	0
i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .	1
great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous .	1
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .	1
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .	1
i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell ! .	1
the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .	0
the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .	1
even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .	1
the file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use .	1
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users .	1
customer service : awful . listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier .	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .	1
there are a lot of things i like about it .	1
its well made and user friendly .	1
turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? . i have to check again = ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date .	1
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .	0
my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be .	0
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .	0
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from .	1
looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .	0
just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .	0
its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips ) .	0
battery : compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around .	0
the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .	1
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .	1
i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .	1
the os is ab it confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve ! .	0
after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures .	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! .	0
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .	1
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .	1
all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews .	0
yes , the features are numerous .	1
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it .	1
i absolutely love it .	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .	1
second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating .	0
i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho ) .	1
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .	1
i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason : to keep the zen micro charged .	0
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .	1
the camera and video functionality is decent , i can 't see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will .	1
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .	0
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .	0
sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .	1
i love this phone .	1
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .	1
i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk : it 's all ways in my shiest pocket .	1
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .	0
what i really like about- its quite , it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking .	1
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .	0
if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you ! .	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .	1
it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .	1
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .	1
i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen .	1
it all sounds great too .	1
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda willa .	1
otherwise , this player is awesome ! .	1
"we can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third-party "" asking "" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks ."	0
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .	1
the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does .	1
i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags .	1
all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me .	1
it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .	1
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .	1
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .	1
the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too . ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby .	1
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .	0
the other controls are all very easy to use .	1
i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .	1
this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers .	1
the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great .	1
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .	0
the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust .	0
it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .	0
it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers .	1
the menu is easy to use and understand .	1
my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor .	0
it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course .	1
the only problem is the size of the keys .	0
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc .	1
second , it is incredibly easy to use .	1
this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .	0
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .	1
if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere .	0
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .	0
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings .	1
who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .	0
this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device .	1
getting files onto it is quick and painless .	1
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .	1
i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature .	0
photos are pretty darned good ! .	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; . it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .	1
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( laos angele's ) is horrendous .	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .	1
"i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! ."	0
just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time .	1
however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority .	1
the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys .	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .	1
i tried called apex cu st service , no help .	0
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .	0
this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see .	0
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .	1
i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures .	1
the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality .	1
for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better .	1
the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality .	1
this is my first digital camera and i could n 't be happier .	1
especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications ) .	1
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .	0
in my table the m12v has been a real champ .	1
this is also the case with nis 2004 .	1
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .	1
the m12v has been great .	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .	0
everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .	1
both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .	1
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .	1
the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! . )	1
the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software .	0
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .	0
the phone does not have an mp3-player , fm radio , 200k+ color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor .	0
one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it 'd be a goner .	0
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ) .	0
we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! .	1
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .	1
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .	1
but the earbuds suck ! .	0
- radio quality : weak reception	0
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .	0
transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .	1
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .	1
2 ) not very ergonomically - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )	0
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .	0
i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ) .	1
though nearly a dozen different people at both t-mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices .	0
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .	1
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .	0
while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch .	0
the software , which comes with player is not good at all .	0
yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best .	1
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .	1
nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .	1
with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on/off controls ) .	0
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .	1
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .	1
also , some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files , whereas the ipod does not .	0
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .	1
"who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "" foreign "" computer just to move over some simple ( * . txt ) files ? ."	0
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .	1
it is an extremely cool cozmo .	1
but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me .	1
very small .	1
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .	1
this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .	1
es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now .	0
also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance .	0
unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later .	0
"i could take 1/2 "" passes and it still didn 't skip a beat ."	1
i am quite happy with the camera .	1
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .	0
i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much .	0
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .	1
only used for 3 month before it 's down ! .	0
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .	1
the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results .	1
but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .	0
4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices .	1
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .	1
"it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time ."	0
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .	1
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .	1
this linksys router does it for the right price .	1
i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen .	0
it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems .	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage .	1
if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way ! .	0
to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid .	0
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .	1
"oh , and another is the cool "" halo "" light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer ."	1
the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel .	0
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .	1
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .	0
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .	0
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! .	1
so far , the anti-spam feature seems to be very good .	1
video recording is limited at just 9 seconds .	0
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .	1
i simply love this feature .	1
"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it ."	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .	0
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .	1
3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card	0
unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot .	1
i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; . there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to .	1
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .	0
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .	0
it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .	1
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ) .	1
i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available .	0
travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket	1
the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion .	1
having the digic ii chip helps a lot .	1
i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .	1
ok , not quite everything . . . but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it .	1
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .	1
1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills .	1
there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy ! .	1
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .	1
i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ! . .	1
within one month , my player completely died .	0
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .	0
back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run .	0
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .	0
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .	1
i enjoy getting use to the touch pad .	1
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .	1
one : it 's size : it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs ) .	1
and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .	1
"also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ) ."	0
i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it .	1
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .	0
the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark .	0
only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet .	0
"the box proudly displays "" securest ( tm ) "" "" wireless made simple "" "" one touch setup button "" "" easy start "" "" easy security "" "" easy everyday "" apparently linksys/cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial ."	0
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .	0
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .	1
the sound is amazing .	1
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .	0
"in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera ."	1
it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths .	1
pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all .	0
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .	1
5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! .	0
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers .	0
it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! .	1
the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 . 1 sound good ) .	1
if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson .	1
now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! .	0
however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ) .	0
i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .	1
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .	1
"the "" movies "" last about 5 seconds ."	0
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .	1
the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .	1
this router has soft start and runs smooth and true .	1
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .	1
*holds a lot of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! .	1
for the price and features it is really good .	1
i couldn 't get the install wizard to work .	0
you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved .	0
"5 ) video recorder is of no use and one can not record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "" free picture and video messaging "" offered by service provider ."	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .	1
a decent piece of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality .	1
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .	0
using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod .	1
the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player .	1
1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .	0
pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble .	1
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .	0
i really regret signing up with t-mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract .	0
as it turns out , this is an awesome camera ! .	1
i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it .	0
this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .	1
it seems like the software is just not responding .	0
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .	1
the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .	1
it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer ! .	1
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .	1
have had the player since xmas's and love it ! .	1
i was using the cheaper pail . . . and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart .	1
the price / performance looked just right .	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems .	0
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .	1
its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 . . . so with all that said , buy the router ! . ! . ! . ! .	1
only if we could get one camera in it . .	0
also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .	1
the extra gb is just a bonus .	1
not plug & play ; . relies on id3 ; . no fm or recording	0
i then realized a major design flaw .	0
don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .	1
the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy .	1
the digital zoom is crap .	0
i am so pleased with this product ! . ! . ! .	1
the vibrate setting is loud ! .	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .	0
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .	0
glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality .	1
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .	1
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .	0
the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10 , it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast .	1
powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on .	1
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .	0
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2 . 5 mm headset jack .	0
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .	1
pc cable is too expensive . . . $ 50 for a usb cable ? .	0
+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +usb cable ! .	1
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .	1
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .	1
the screen 's large and easily read .	1
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .	1
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .	1
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .	0
no vibration ! .	1
silverfish color really adds a special touch .	1
i love this product ! .	1
they take excellent macro shots as well .	1
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface .	1
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; . it does not charge by usb cable ; . this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .	0
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .	0
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .	1
i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .	1
strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish .	1
so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby ! .	1
decent battery -- on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock .	1
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo's .	1
i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can 't tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail .	0
yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone .	0
the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480 .	0
*	0
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .	1
so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .	1
also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones .	0
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .	1
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! .	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! .	1
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .	1
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .	1
first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc .	1
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .	0
moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go .	1
i really have no complaints over this unit .	1
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .	0
these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :	1
could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over iso100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefact's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video-playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight .	1
it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work .	1
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .	0
"1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , "" dad ! . somethings wrong with the dvd player ! . come quick ! . """	0
"unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type ."	0
"i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much strainers , seldom falling below the "" very good "" range ( and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router ."	1
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .	0
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .	1
seems to work great .	1
i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it .	1
the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack .	1
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool .	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .	0
the picture rs are amazing .	1
then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .	0
take quick pictures with excelent resolution	1
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .	1
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .	1
the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick .	1
however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release .	0
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .	0
the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire .	1
overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion .	0
the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid .	1
speed is not a problem .	1
i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great .	1
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .	1
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .	0
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .	0
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .	1
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .	1
the hard case they give with it must work well .	1
they have the worst service of any of the major companies .	0
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .	1
the touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player .	0
usb 2 . 0 - very fast	1
"that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the "" add to cart "" button already ! ."	1
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .	1
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .	0
i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! . ! . ! .	1
"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" ."	0
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .	1
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .	1
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .	1
pick your favorite color and buy it .	1
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .	1
"got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase ."	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .	0
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but can not be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .	0
"a lot of "" fragments "" were left in the registry , and it the norton system folders ."	0
the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .	0
very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon .	1
the sound is quite good , in terms of volume .	1
well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry .	1
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man ( toy/junk ) routers i have previously purchased .	1
it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up .	0
the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing .	1
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .	1
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .	1
the entire unit was poorly crafted .	0
either way , can 't go wrong with this price .	1
it is a nice router in all ways but one .	1
i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky .	0
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! . ! .	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .	0
perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways .	1
i 'm not sure why all the bad reviews , my computer isn 't especially slowed down and i have win '98 .	1
creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast .	1
and , other else , the camera is still vga .	0
i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself .	1
the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service .	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .	1
also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating internet security .	0
i like the automatic key lock function .	1
the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .	0
multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone .	1
other than that , i love this camera .	1
it is quiet and has plenty of power .	1
a little weighty ( 9 ounces . . . no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .	0
a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .	1
5 . the price is right .	1
however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup .	0
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .	0
the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; . not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .	1
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .	0
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .	1
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit .	1
incredible memory ! .	1
poor visibility on the keys .	0
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .	0
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .	1
i just bought this player today and i already love it .	1
i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones .	0
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .	1
