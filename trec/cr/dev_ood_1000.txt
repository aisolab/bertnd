i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! .	1
i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities .	1
otherwise , this player is awesome ! .	1
seriously ! . i love it ! .	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .	1
bluetooth does not work on this phone .	0
it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers .	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .	0
apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services .	0
i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ! . .	1
3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card	0
strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish .	1
incredible memory ! .	1
i simply love this feature .	1
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .	1
it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever .	1
"4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "" other than phone "" functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done ."	0
the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .	1
the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend .	0
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! .	0
nokia does not disappoint in this model .	1
sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application .	0
recently the variable speed control went out .	0
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .	0
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .	0
) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors . .	1
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .	1
one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well .	1
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .	0
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .	0
this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite .	1
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .	0
also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you .	1
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .	1
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! . ! .	0
silver metal case -not plastic .	1
great camera .	1
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .	1
the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth .	0
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .	0
very simple and painless .	1
pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room .	1
you need the software to actually transfer files	0
creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .	1
i upgraded from a very small 3 . 2 max camera to this camera with great results .	1
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .	1
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod's dirty secret . com .	1
start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .	0
this camera has a major design flaw .	0
finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .	0
for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy .	1
the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life .	0
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .	1
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .	1
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .	1
at 128 the songs sound very good .	1
this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example .	1
all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .	1
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas .	0
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .	0
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .	1
i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $300 systematic because he saw what this router can do .	1
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! .	1
the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple-approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time .	1
overall , a very disappointing product .	0
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .	0
( batteries last longer too ! . )	1
it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up .	0
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .	1
"you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "" special edition "" to get black ! . - sound : awesome ! . - batteries : removable/replaceable ."	1
even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track .	0
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! .	1
i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size .	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player .	1
i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! . ! . ! .	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .	0
it also lets you remove songs from the play order .	1
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .	1
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n 't figure out a way to break it .	0
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .	1
all in all , not very good .	0
00% good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks .	0
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .	1
overall , a good buy for the price .	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .	1
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .	0
whatever . . . on to the negatives : -touchy about charging . . . you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .	0
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) . . .	0
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .	1
as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears .	0
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .	1
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .	1
all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one .	1
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .	1
the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .	1
overall , this product is awesome .	1
creative did an awesome job with the design .	1
camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution .	1
the storage capacity is great for me --	1
the phone is very light weight .	1
we 've never experienced odor from the pail .	1
after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ) .	0
after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .	1
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .	1
in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless .	0
although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better .	0
i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it .	0
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .	1
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .	0
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .	1
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache .	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality .	0
this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .	1
no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications .	0
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .	1
this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .	1
it has plenty of power .	1
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .	1
5 stars all the way ! .	1
but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100 .	1
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .	1
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table .	0
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .	1
it will not replace your high-end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots .	1
and the remote is cheap and ch easy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! .	0
* eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files .	0
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .	1
i find this to be a great feature .	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! .	0
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .	1
the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .	0
i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod 'mini ' - basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives .	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .	0
7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .	0
fm radio built in ( howard stern ) .	1
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .	0
weak points : - touch pad : design could be better - volume control : controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick .	0
you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .	1
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .	0
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it .	1
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .	0
norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low .	1
i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .	1
i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .	1
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .	1
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .	0
good looks	1
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .	1
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .	1
like other reviewers , installation was hell .	0
unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs .	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .	1
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? .	0
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .	1
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers .	0
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .	0
bottom line great phone for the time being .	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s .	1
the panorama modes are wonderful .	1
the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod .	1
"decently sized screen -- one of the larger ones on the market at 2 """	1
i use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems .	1
everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .	1
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .	1
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .	1
so for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models i 've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & i like that .	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .	0
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .	1
ok , not quite everything . . . but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it .	1
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .	1
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .	1
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? .	1
the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .	1
even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys .	1
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone .	1
no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .	1
"my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of "" brick . "" *"	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .	1
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .	0
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .	0
if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while .	0
i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good .	1
i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .	1
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .	0
the touch pad is over-sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive .	0
cons - difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor .	0
our norton internet/av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok .	0
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you .	0
the image quality is excellent .	1
and it is extremely well-priced for what you 're getting .	1
i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it .	0
overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood* .	1
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .	1
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .	1
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .	1
they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .	1
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .	0
pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .	1
perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways .	1
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .	1
hard drive screws up occasionally	0
however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .	0
no matter the format .	1
very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon .	1
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .	1
when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin .	0
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing .	1
wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .	1
some adjustments in the settings could help make it better .	0
audio is excellent .	1
the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too . ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby .	1
great colors , pictures and white balance .	1
the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2 . 0 , xp os ) .	0
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .	1
if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere .	0
that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism .	0
it also does n 't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! . ! .	0
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .	0
-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .	0
the only problem is the size of the keys .	0
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .	0
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .	0
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .	1
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits .	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .	1
it was also the most appealing .	1
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .	0
the in ital setup of the router was simple .	1
) button sensitivity : even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive .	0
1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .	0
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100 .	1
finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier .	0
the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa .	1
just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .	1
i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler .	1
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .	0
other than that , i love this camera .	1
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .	1
"warning ! . the windows "" remove program "" feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program ."	0
getting files onto it is quick and painless .	1
the karma is only $5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog .	0
i do give create to creative for their attractive design .	1
but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! .	1
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .	0
the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server .	1
the sound quality is very good .	1
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .	1
another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily .	0
the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .	1
value : comparing data storage with price .	1
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .	1
sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two .	0
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .	1
they 're easy to use .	1
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .	1
this is ridiculous .	0
it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .	1
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .	1
2 ) phone is awfully slow .	0
you indefinitely appreciate the small size .	1
if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you .	1
so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .	1
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .	0
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .	1
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .	1
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .	0
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .	1
b . fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 . 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .	1
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .	1
8- buttons are little , but if you have steady fingers and deal ed with a casio worst calculator watch , you can deal with almost anything .	0
+ screen was good , easy to read	1
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .	0
i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty .	1
it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .	1
and so far , i 've been very pleased .	1
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .	0
it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera .	1
2 ) scroll button / switch	0
we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $6 . 00 for a year of bags- can 't beat that ! . ! .	1
speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! .	1
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .	1
1 . your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism .	0
these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .	0
if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter .	1
"as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "" plunger "" to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full ."	0
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .	1
it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot .	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice verse ) was easy too .	1
for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 . 0 .	1
i thought the software was decent enough - it was n 't complicated to learn at all .	1
all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional .	0
fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it .	0
the phone does not have an mp3-player , fm radio , 200k+ color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor .	0
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .	1
"the box proudly displays "" securest ( tm ) "" "" wireless made simple "" "" one touch setup button "" "" easy start "" "" easy security "" "" easy everyday "" apparently linksys/cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial ."	0
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard .	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon . never knew i could love a digital camera so much .	1
very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models .	1
they are not wow able good .	0
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .	1
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .	1
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .	0
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .	1
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .	0
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .	1
apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini .	0
and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space .	1
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .	1
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .	1
6- small but very clear tft screen .	1
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .	0
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .	1
the 6600 has more amenities than most - world phone , camera ( vga/zoom/night mode/timer ) , video ( w/ audio & zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more .	1
the m12v has been great .	1
it has great incredibility .	1
it is hot enough to be annoying .	0
the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect .	1
but with a low price , comes lower quality .	0
while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets .	1
the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed .	0
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .	0
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .	1
the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer .	1
putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .	1
the quality is superb .	1
after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support . . . . they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful .	0
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .	0
for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .	0
the scroll wheel is finicky ; . it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; . new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; . some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .	0
doesn 't have alot of good games on it .	0
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .	0
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .	1
its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it .	1
unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .	1
now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here .	1
this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers .	1
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .	1
also , the lens cap design is flawed .	0
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! .	1
i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise .	0
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from .	1
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s/w worked well to connect .	1
the good : small size ; . durable-seeming metal case ; . easy to use ; . visually distinctive ; . good picture quality ; . fast usb connection ; . mostly intuitive operation ; . really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas .	1
the ad-1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .	0
downloads are a snap and quick .	1
it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full .	0
i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer .	0
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .	0
the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .	0
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .	1
download it fast to your computer	1
camera is a paper weight .	1
silverfish color really adds a special touch .	1
"unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type ."	0
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .	1
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .	1
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .	0
the powershot g3 is a great camera .	1
i like the automatic key lock function .	1
i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .	1
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .	0
but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful- it 's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying .	1
but this camera is great ! .	1
i have had no problems with the phone .	1
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; . shutter delay is n 't so bad either .	1
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot . . . .	1
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; . when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; . if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click .	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .	1
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .	1
for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player .	1
i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .	1
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line .	1
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .	1
there was neither picture nor sound .	0
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .	1
the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients .	1
so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation ! .	1
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital . com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .	0
i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage .	0
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .	0
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .	1
"i have only used it with the 1/4 "" collet and a 1/2 "" round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly ."	1
the earbud headphones are really nice .	1
i am very pleased so far .	1
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .	1
great design -- very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( virtual ones are the only competition ) ; . and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus .	1
battery life keeps improving on the ipod , and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time , per charge .	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie .	1
it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket .	1
takes excellent photos .	1
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! .	1
it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges .	1
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! .	1
the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application .	0
works great ! .	1
and , other else , the camera is still vga .	0
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more .	1
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .	0
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .	1
the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .	0
do not buy any home version of norton anything .	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .	1
1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .	1
the fm radio is cool .	1
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider .	1
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .	0
and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .	1
i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell ! .	1
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack .	1
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .	1
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .	0
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .	1
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .	1
however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release .	0
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .	1
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones ! .	0
the cons are n 't really a big deal to me . . . except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files . . . no folder structure . . . and it 's based on the title of the songs . . . many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) . . . and a few had same titles . . . so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another .	0
i love the quality of the pictures .	1
sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected .	1
it 's easy .	1
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .	1
this player is an ideal purchase .	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .	0
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .	1
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
"i will never use all the "" whistles and bells "" this machine is capable of ."	1
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .	0
so far i have no complaints with this player .	1
the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless .	0
other than that , i think it is the best router for the money .	1
despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) . . . does more than most . . . does it well . . . is dependable .	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .	1
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc .	1
so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .	1
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .	0
and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow .	1
the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area .	0
multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone .	1
: ! . ok , score 7 . 0 oh yes , the newest color of this phone is quite cool .	1
however , this product performed well below my expectation .	0
we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! .	1
i love this product ! .	1
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless .	0
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5/5 stars = ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! . ( digital zoom only though ) . . . but still . . . ( my old one can 't do that . . . you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip . )	1
* slick-looking design and improved interface	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .	1
the installation , set-up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well .	1
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .	1
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .	1
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .	0
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .	1
"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" ."	0
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players	0
4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices .	1
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .	0
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .	1
the sound is amazing .	1
the touchpad is annoying sometimes ( give me the click-wheel and pres sable buttons any day ) , but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying .	0
this makes for a great phone .	1
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .	0
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! .	1
luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! . it is indeed worth nothing .	1
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .	1
this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240 .	1
creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories .	1
it works well with my vip adapter , which is also a linksys .	1
i just bought this player today and i already love it .	1
i love the features , the interface , the size ( the screen is a delight ) , the camera ( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me ) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc .	1
nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price	1
do n 't buy this player .	0
absolutely no problems with this router .	1
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
4- looks great .	1
works pretty well .	1
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .	0
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly .	1
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer .	1
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .	0
it is a very amazing product .	1
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .	1
pros . 1 . speed 2 . signal strength 3 . advanced configuration options	1
i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles .	0
really easy to use .	1
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .	0
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .	1
then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely .	0
after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon . com and see for yourself ) .	0
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38 ; . t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .	1
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .	1
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .	0
it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course .	1
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .	0
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .	0
8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth .	1
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .	1
i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well .	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .	0
i 've had no problems with the software .	1
sound quality ? . phenomenal .	1
i highly recommend this phone .	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use .	1
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .	0
interface - practically seamless .	1
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; . an exceptional close-up shooting capability .	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .	1
the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! . ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e . g . covers of songs ) , etc .	1
+battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality . . . i mean it is creative right ? .	1
i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .	1
the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year .	1
i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! .	1
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera .	0
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .	0
i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .	1
we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped .	0
i have the black one and adore it .	1
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .	0
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .	1
the battery life is amazing .	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .	0
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .	1
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches .	0
the collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out .	0
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .	1
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .	1
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .	0
am so glad i bought this camera .	1
the vibrate setting is loud ! .	0
"the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make . . ."	1
if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget .	1
when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .	0
it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer ! .	1
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .	1
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .	0
so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! .	1
i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen .	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .	0
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .	1
the vibration is not top .	0
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .	1
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .	1
pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all .	0
his is what i get for my $200 on this mp3 player ? .	0
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .	1
it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! .	1
it has everything i needed : bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a good operating system with lots of supporting software .	1
powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on .	1
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .	0
usb 2 . 0 - very fast	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .	1
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :	1
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .	0
as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen .	1
the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .	1
i 'm really happy with this purchase .	1
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .	0
the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17 .	0
well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn 't working right and once again , after consulting customer se ! .	0
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .	1
the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too ; . they look as though they were built out of lego's .	0
gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore .	0
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n 't take weeks to figure out how to operate .	1
i find it pretty easy to use . . . and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) . . .	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! .	0
yes , the features are numerous .	1
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .	0
2 . you still have to clean the thing ! . ! .	0
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so .	1
i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons .	1
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )	1
neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )	0
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .	1
i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs .	1
the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you've got .	1
the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot .	1
friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .	1
fact is , it could n 't be easier to use .	1
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .	1
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .	0
and the video quality is amazing .	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .	1
- the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! .	1
first , it serious , serious installation problems .	0
on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software ! .	0
cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality .	0
the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality .	1
this is a wonderful camera .	1
i 'd give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .	1
the extra gb is just a bonus .	1
but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design .	0
i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did .	1
other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better .	0
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be	1
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it 's job .	0
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .	0
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .	1
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .	1
i see many other reviews that say the same . . . . stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone ! .	0
however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority .	1
the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved .	0
built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .	1
if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .	1
another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers .	1
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .	0
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .	1
this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to :	1
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . )	1
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .	1
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .	1
the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive .	1
it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately .	1
you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved .	0
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! .	1
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers .	0
update ( march 2005 ) : my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby : - )	1
this is an excellent router for the money .	1
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .	1
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable .	1
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .	1
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature . . . but not on this player . . .	0
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 . 0 .	1
it sure does ! .	1
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .	1
"my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field ."	0
it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house .	1
the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .	1
it films 10 second video , for crying out loud .	1
- very long-lasting battery life	1
this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .	1
the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .	1
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .	1
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .	1
plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great .	1
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it .	1
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .	0
it 's being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers ( headphone jack , player locking up , etc ) .	1
my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made .	0
i prefer things that are simple .	1
noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .	1
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .	1
overall i 'm happy with my toy .	1
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .	0
and we definitely prefer our champ ! .	1
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .	0
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .	1
5 . the price is right .	1
even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .	1
the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features .	1
i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet .	1
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .	1
i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the	1
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .	0
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .	0
i tried to do this by instinct and it 's not intuitive unless you are a network geek .	0
however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off .	0
the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company .	1
es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now .	0
it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .	0
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 . it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .	1
nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .	1
"it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time ."	0
well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry .	1
there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to .	0
and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative .	0
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .	1
2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon's .	1
also much less stinky .	0
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car .	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .	1
i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ) .	1
the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results .	1
dependability : i 've seen no glitches .	1
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .	0
got way too many blurry pictures .	0
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .	1
also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones .	0
it has never worked .	0
what i like the most : - small and solid feel .	1
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .	0
the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly .	1
i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this .	1
also , not liking the gel case .	0
transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .	1
after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up .	0
the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera .	1
this is one of the best purchases we made .	1
the zen micro is near perfect .	1
especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications ) .	1
i must have gotten a good one .	1
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .	1
the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player .	1
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .	1
1 ) the champ is easy to use .	1
again , every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .	0
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .	1
all the good reviews for the sd500 are true .	1
stay away from this junk .	0
1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .	0
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .	1
the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle .	1
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .	1
3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs ( why 'd u buy it then ? . ! . ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias .	0
what impressed me most was the sound .	1
smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one .	1
it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user .	0
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .	1
take quick pictures with excelent resolution	1
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .	1
2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots .	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .	0
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .	1
this is a benefit for many reasons ; . one being just for appearance , your pants wo n 't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .	1
saw the hitachi on amazon . com with their $25 . 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out .	1
goes ~3 days after a charge .	1
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .	1
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .	1
applications : it has lots of applications and they work very well . . . when you eventually find where they are and they finally open .	1
i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gpp-compatible and real media video clips .	1
for the price and features it is really good .	1
i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money .	1
i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help .	0
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion .	1
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .	0
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .	1
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .	0
pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set .	1
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .	0
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .	1
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; . only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .	0
when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better	1
handset quality is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality .	1
this is really a no brain er .	1
this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .	1
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .	0
it works easily with one hand , which is important .	1
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .	1
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .	0
so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby ! .	1
i love this player .	1
i really have no complaints over this unit .	1
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .	1
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .	0
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .	1
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .	1
my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor .	0
the door would not close .	0
this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact , take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot .	1
after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me $40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty ) .	0
capacity is not a problem here .	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .	1
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile .	0
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .	0
this product is too fragile for normal use .	0
"it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song "" piece of cr -- ! . "" , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to ."	0
the dvd player does not work properly .	0
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .	0
excellent sound i mean the player has juice .	1
in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera .	1
this is also the case with nis 2004 .	1
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .	1
the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .	0
this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time .	1
i couldn 't get the install wizard to work .	0
"the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . ."	0
they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic's and sennheisers .	1
ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1 . 1 usb ) .	1
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! .	1
"about the product : the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to "" hip "" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the "" awkward "" factor ."	1
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; . cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price .	1
while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more . . . without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .	1
im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .	0
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago .	1
very sturdy and strong .	1
the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery .	1
yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone .	0
some dvd 's i rented would not play .	0
but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .	1
i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen .	0
linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of disco .	0
"also , when i dial an "" 800 "" number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu ."	0
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .	0
this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see .	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .	0
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n 't always accurate .	0
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .	0
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .	0
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .	1
four megapixels is great .	1
could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over iso100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefact's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video-playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight .	1
i love this phone .	1
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .	1
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .	0
i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it .	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .	1
again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .	0
it is a nice router in all ways but one .	1
wo n 't play a lot of discs .	0
5- excelent software package .	1
otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player .	1
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .	0
after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem .	0
this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks .	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .	0
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .	0
the phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card . . . and turning the phone back on takes a little while .	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .	1
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .	1
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v .	1
this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system .	0
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda willa .	1
"also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage ."	1
i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it ! .	1
the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great .	1
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .	1
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	1
it 's easy to use . not too small , and not too big .	1
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record .	1
we use the cheap $1 . 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around .	1
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad	1
still has terrible software .	0
if you do n 't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .	0
sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .	1
it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket .	1
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .	0
was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac .	0
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .	1
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual .	1
"the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "" what diaper smell "" in less time than that ."	1
the interface works great .	1
i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face .	1
can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .	1
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .	1
the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .	1
8 battery life is excellent .	1
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .	1
this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router .	1
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! .	1
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .	0
but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .	1
it is quiet and has plenty of power .	1
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :	1
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention . . . the sound quality is excellent ! .	1
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .	1
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .	0
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .	0
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .	1
wish i could give it 4 1/2 stars .	1
and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own .	1
it still smelled .	0
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
i would recommend this product to anyone .	1
good sound -- plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable -- not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy	1
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .	1
i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .	1
my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature .	0
though nearly a dozen different people at both t-mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices .	0
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4-5 megapixel .	1
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .	1
i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra . . . and i was not disappointed .	1
the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing .	1
initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .	1
i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed .	0
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .	0
i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked ! .	0
i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .	0
also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! . ) and so does the smell of their diapers ! .	0
i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems .	1
well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more .	1
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .	0
no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor . '	1
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .	0
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .	0
it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .	1
3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .	0
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .	1
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you .	1
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .	1
this is a must have product for all new moms ! .	1
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records .	1
6 . play game boy color games on it with go boy .	1
nis 2003 worked like a charm last year .	1
i highly recommend it .	1
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day .	0
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .	1
if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .	0
the phone is sturdy .	1
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .	1
so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .	0
as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer ' .	1
the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection .	0
it 's too bad , though , that ! .	0
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a pda .	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .	0
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .	0
( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked .	0
this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 ! .	0
1 ) it is perhaps too small .	0
i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .	0
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .	0
with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on/off controls ) .	0
the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's $25 incentive ( you need the code -- -go to tool seeker . com and it tells you )	1
it ain 't cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain 't pretty .	0
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .	1
as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .	1
as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .	1
and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim-card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists .	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .	0
the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually .	0
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .	0
i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out- well , just be prepared .	0
i got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .	1
battery life is good for a phone of this size .	1
all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera .	0
the moveable lcd screen is great .	1
few month ago , it 's very popular among my community .	1
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .	1
i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great .	1
photos are pretty darned good ! .	1
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .	0
and the battery life is bad ! .	0
nice little phone . . . light compact . .	1
great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great .	1
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .	1
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on	0
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! .	1
it 's a very intuitive program .	1
this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .	0
"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it ."	0
7 picture quality is excellent .	1
the size of the camera is perfect .	1
and amazon . com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? .	1
some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .	1
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc . ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .	0
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .	0
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .	1
the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark .	0
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .	1
the price is $ . . . more .	0
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ) .	1
my only complaint ( really more of an observation ) is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate , so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn 't get all scratched up .	0
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .	1
also , very light and portable .	1
i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .	1
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .	0
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .	0
this model appears to be especially good .	1
- the software that came with it was tough to load .	0
the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack .	1
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .	0
it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it .	0
i haven 't seen any problems yet , but if you don 't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up .	0
another 5 star performance .	1
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! .	0
i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy .	1
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! .	1
you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ .	1
purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever .	1
2- excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! . ! . ! .	1
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo's .	1
"even the "" shorter "" battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way ."	0
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .	0
if you think you are saving $40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a makita .	0
setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate .	1
i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the digital rebel .	0
i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down .	1
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .	1
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual .	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage .	1
this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )	0
